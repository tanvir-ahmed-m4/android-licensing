# android-licensing

This library is a port of the Android LVL licensing code to gradle for easy inclusion into
your project. If you want to customize the licensing code, you can still copy the source
into your project, but this library provides an easy way to get started.

## Setup

Add the dependency to your build.gradle:

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.erd:android-licensing:1.2.0'
    }
